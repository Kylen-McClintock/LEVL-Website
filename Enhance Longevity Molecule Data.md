# **The Periodic Table of Longevity: A Mechanistic Compendium of Geroprotective Molecules**

## **1\. Introduction: The Molecular Architecture of Healthspan**

The aging process is no longer viewed as an inevitable, passive slide into entropy. Instead, contemporary geroscience recognizes it as a malleable biological phenomenon governed by specific, interconnected molecular pathways. These pathways, when dysregulated, manifest as the "Hallmarks of Aging"—a conceptual framework that categorizes the drivers of age-related decline. These hallmarks include Genomic Instability, Telomere Attrition, Epigenetic Alterations, Loss of Proteostasis, Deregulated Nutrient Sensing, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cellular Senescence, Stem Cell Exhaustion, and Altered Intercellular Communication.

The "Periodic Table of Longevity" presented in this report is not merely a list of supplements; it is a curated arsenal of bioactive compounds capable of intervening in these aging processes. This report provides an exhaustive, expert-level analysis of 96 distinct molecular entries. For each entry, we present a "Geek Mode"—a deep-dive technical monograph that elucidates the pharmacodynamics, molecular targets, and mechanistic pathways by which these molecules influence the fundamental hallmarks of aging and translate into tangible functional outcomes like enhanced cognition, metabolic resilience, and systemic recovery.

By synthesizing data from cutting-edge preclinical trials, human interventions, and biochemical assays 1, this compendium bridges the gap between molecular biology and practical longevity interventions.

**2\. Mitochondrial Optimizers and Redox Modulators**

This category encompasses molecules that primarily target **Mitochondrial Dysfunction** and **Genomic Instability**. The mitochondria are the energetic hubs of the cell; their decline compromises ATP production and increases oxidative stress (ROS), leading to DNA damage. The agents below aim to restore electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency, replenish NAD+ pools, and scavenge radicals via phase II enzyme induction.

### **1\. Fullerene (C60)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Energy; Recovery; Cognition |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Genomic Instability; Loss of Proteostasis; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
Fullerene (C60), specifically the buckminsterfullerene allotrope of carbon, operates as a unique, reusable radical scavenger. Unlike traditional antioxidants that are consumed upon neutralizing a free radical, C60 possesses a conjugated double-bond structure with high electron affinity, allowing it to accept and reversibly store multiple electrons. This property enables it to act as an "electron sponge," effectively neutralizing superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals without becoming a pro-oxidant itself.2 Mechanistically, C60 accumulates within the mitochondrial lipid bilayer. Here, theoretical models and in vitro studies suggest it acts as a protonophore, facilitating a mild uncoupling of the mitochondrial membrane potential.2  
This mild uncoupling effect mimics the action of uncoupling proteins (UCPs), reducing the proton motive force slightly—enough to diminish the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at Complex I and III of the electron transport chain (ETC), but not enough to compromise ATP synthesis significantly. By lowering mitochondrial ROS production at the source, C60 protects mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from oxidative lesions (Genomic Instability) and preserves the structural integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Mitochondrial Dysfunction). Furthermore, C60 has been observed to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides and reduce neuroinflammation by modulating microglial activation, thereby addressing Loss of Proteostasis and Altered Intercellular Communication in neural tissues.4

### **2\. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Recovery; Immunity; Energy |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Loss of Proteostasis; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Genomic Instability; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) functions primarily as a membrane-permeable prodrug for L-cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid in the biosynthesis of Glutathione (GSH). Upon entering the cell, NAC is deacetylated to release cysteine, which is then utilized by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) to form gamma-glutamylcysteine, the precursor to GSH. By replenishing intracellular GSH pools, NAC directly combats Genomic Instability and Mitochondrial Dysfunction caused by oxidative stress.6 GSH serves as the essential cofactor for glutathione peroxidase (GPx), an enzyme responsible for reducing hydrogen peroxide to water and detoxifying lipid hydroperoxides.  
Beyond its role in GSH synthesis, the free thiol group of NAC possesses direct antioxidant activity, capable of scavenging hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid. NAC also modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission by activating the cystine-glutamate antiporter (System xc-), which increases non-synaptic glutamate levels to stimulate presynaptic mGluR2/3 receptors, thereby dampening excessive excitatory transmission. This mechanism is crucial for neuroprotection and reducing "excitotoxicity." Furthermore, NAC has been shown to break disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, improving respiratory health, and to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 (Chronic Inflammation).7

### **3\. Sulforaphane**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Metabolism; Immunity; Recovery |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Genomic Instability; Loss of Proteostasis; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin (found in cruciferous vegetables), is a potent activator of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2\) signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is tethered in the cytoplasm by Keap1, which targets it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane interacts with the cysteine thiols of Keap1, inducing a conformational change that prevents Nrf2 degradation.9 Stabilized Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to Antioxidant Response Elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of cytoprotective genes.  
This binding triggers the massive transcriptional upregulation of Phase II detoxification enzymes, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). This coordinated response enhances the cell's capacity to neutralize electrophiles and ROS, thereby protecting against Genomic Instability and protein oxidation (Loss of Proteostasis). Sulforaphane also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of NF-κB, thus suppressing the secretion of SASP (Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype) factors from senescent cells. Additionally, it has been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, potentially influencing Epigenetic Alterations associated with aging.11

### **4\. Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Energy; Metabolism; Recovery |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Deregulated Nutrient Sensing; Loss of Proteostasis; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a unique dithiol compound that functions as an essential cofactor for mitochondrial α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These enzymes are critical gatekeepers of the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and driving ATP production. By supporting these enzymatic reactions, ALA directly ameliorates Mitochondrial Dysfunction and enhances cellular bioenergetics.13 ALA is also part of a potent redox couple with its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). DHLA has a low redox potential, allowing it to regenerate other endogenous antioxidants, including Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Glutathione, from their oxidized states.  
Furthermore, ALA acts as an insulin mimetic by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), which dephosphorylates the insulin receptor. Inhibition of PTP1B prolongs the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), enhancing downstream PI3K/Akt signaling and stimulating GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. This mechanism improves glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity, directly addressing Deregulated Nutrient Sensing. ALA has also been shown to activate AMPK in skeletal muscle, leading to increased fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α activation.15

### **5\. Zinc**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Immunity; Recovery; Metabolism |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Genomic Instability; Loss of Proteostasis; Chronic Inflammation; Stem Cell Exhaustion |

Geek Mode:  
Zinc is an essential trace element that serves as a catalytic or structural cofactor for over 300 enzymes and roughly 2,000 transcription factors. Its role in maintaining Genomic Instability is paramount; zinc is a critical component of "zinc finger" proteins, which are DNA-binding domains required for the function of DNA repair enzymes (like OGG1 and APE1) and tumor suppressor proteins like p53. Zinc deficiency leads to oxidative DNA damage and impairs the DNA damage response (DDR). Zinc also regulates Loss of Proteostasis by serving as a cofactor for metalloproteases and by inducing the expression of metallothioneins, cysteine-rich proteins that scavenge hydroxyl radicals and sequester heavy metals.17  
In the context of the immune system, zinc is essential for the biological activity of thymulin, a thymic hormone required for T-cell differentiation and maturation. Age-related zinc deficiency is a driver of thymic involution and immunosenescence (Stem Cell Exhaustion). Additionally, zinc functions as an intracellular signaling molecule that inhibits the activity of IκB kinase (IKK), preventing the activation of NF-κB and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β (Chronic Inflammation). It also antagonizes the NMDA receptor, protecting neurons from excitotoxicity.19

### **6\. GlyNAC (Glycine \+ NAC)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Energy; Recovery; Metabolism |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Genomic Instability; Loss of Proteostasis; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
GlyNAC is a combination of Glycine and N-Acetylcysteine, precursors to the tripeptide Glutathione (GSH). While NAC provides cysteine, glycine is often the rate-limiting substrate in aging tissues due to increased metabolic demand. The "Power of Two" concept relies on the simultaneous provision of both precursors to overcome the age-associated decline in GCL and Glutathione Synthetase activity. Clinical trials have demonstrated that GlyNAC supplementation corrects intracellular GSH deficiency more effectively than either compound alone, reversing Mitochondrial Dysfunction by protecting ETC complexes from oxidative damage and improving fatty acid oxidation.6  
Mechanistically, restoring GSH levels with GlyNAC has been shown to reduce markers of oxidative stress (such as F2-isoprostanes) and oxidant damage to DNA (Genomic Instability). It also improves insulin sensitivity and reduces body fat, likely by mitigating oxidative stress-induced insulin resistance in adipose and muscle tissue (Deregulated Nutrient Sensing). Furthermore, GlyNAC supplementation in older adults has been linked to decreased levels of systemic inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP) and improved autophagy, suggesting a broad impact on Loss of Proteostasis and Chronic Inflammation. This restoration of redox homeostasis is critical for maintaining muscle strength and cognitive function in the elderly.7

### **7\. Omega-3 (EPA & DHA)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Cognition; Immunity; Recovery; Metabolism |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Chronic Inflammation; Altered Intercellular Communication; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Loss of Proteostasis |

Geek Mode:  
Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), are structural components of cell membranes that modulate fluidity and receptor function. Their most significant impact on aging is through their conversion into Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs): Resolvins, Protectins, and Maresins. These lipid mediators are biosynthesized via the COX and LOX pathways and actively orchestrate the resolution of inflammation (catabasis). Unlike anti-inflammatory drugs that block the initiation of inflammation, SPMs stimulate macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) and promote the clearance of debris via the lymphatic system, without suppressing the adaptive immune response.23  
DHA is particularly enriched in neuronal membranes and is essential for synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. It activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis via Bcl-2 regulation. Resolvin D1 (derived from DHA) and Resolvin E1 (derived from EPA) inhibit the infiltration of neutrophils and block NF-κB activation, thereby dampening Chronic Inflammation. Additionally, Omega-3s improve Mitochondrial Dysfunction by enhancing the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane (cardiolipin remodeling), which optimizes the efficiency of the electron transport chain and reduces ROS leakage.25

### **8\. GABA**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Calm; Sleep |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Altered Intercellular Communication; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. It acts by binding to ionotropic GABAA receptors (ligand-gated chloride channels) and metabotropic GABAB receptors (G-protein coupled receptors) on postsynaptic neurons. Activation of GABAA receptors leads to an influx of chloride ions, hyperpolarizing the neuron and raising the threshold for action potential generation. This "phasic inhibition" reduces neuronal excitability, countering the effects of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate. This mechanism is essential for regulating anxiety, promoting sleep onset, and preventing excitotoxicity.27  
While GABA's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is debated, evidence suggests that exogenous GABA may act via the enteric nervous system (ENS) and the vagus nerve ("gut-brain axis") to influence central GABA levels. GABAergic signaling is also implicated in the regulation of peripheral inflammation; immune cells express GABA receptors, and GABA activation can suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, GABA production decreases with age, and restoring GABAergic tone may improve cognitive function by refining the signal-to-noise ratio in cortical circuits (Altered Intercellular Communication).29

### **9\. Astragalus Extract**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Immunity; Recovery; Energy |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Telomere Attrition; Stem Cell Exhaustion; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Astragalus membranaceus extracts contain a complex mixture of bioactive compounds, including triterpenoid saponins (astragalosides), flavonoids, and polysaccharides. The most researched mechanism regarding aging is its potential to activate telomerase. Certain fractions of Astragalus have been shown to upregulate the expression of TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase), the catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme. This activity helps to maintain or elongate telomeres in proliferative cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells and T-lymphocytes, thereby delaying replicative senescence and preventing Stem Cell Exhaustion.31  
Beyond telomeres, Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) exhibit potent immunomodulatory effects. They bind to TLR4 receptors on macrophages and dendritic cells, stimulating the release of cytokines and enhancing phagocytic activity. Astragalus also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and reducing the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) on endothelial cells. Furthermore, components like Astragaloside IV improve mitochondrial function by preserving the mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) under stress conditions.33

### **10\. Cycloastragenol**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Recovery; Energy |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Telomere Attrition; Stem Cell Exhaustion; Genomic Instability; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Cycloastragenol is a triterpenoid aglycone derived from the hydrolysis of Astragaloside IV. It is identified as the primary small molecule within Astragalus responsible for telomerase activation. Cycloastragenol acts by transiently increasing the transcription of hTERT, leading to increased telomerase activity in somatic cells. This elongation of critically short telomeres rescues cells from the Hayflick limit, allowing for continued cell division and tissue regeneration. This is particularly relevant for the skin (keratinocytes) and the immune system (CD4/CD8 T-cells), where telomere attrition limits functional capacity.35  
In addition to Telomere Attrition, Cycloastragenol impacts the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and survival. It has been shown to improve lipid metabolism and wound healing in vivo. Recent studies suggest it also modulates the Nrf2/proteasome axis, enhancing the degradation of damaged proteins (Loss of Proteostasis) and upregulating antioxidant enzymes. By maintaining telomere length, Cycloastragenol indirectly prevents Genomic Instability, as critically short telomeres can lead to chromosome fusion and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles.37

### **11\. Astragaloside IV**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Immunity; Recovery; Energy |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Telomere Attrition; Stem Cell Exhaustion; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is the major saponin found in Astragalus root. While it serves as a precursor to cycloastragenol, AS-IV possesses distinct pharmacological properties. It acts as a potent anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signaling axis, which is critical for suppressing the "sterile inflammation" associated with tissue damage and aging. AS-IV also protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress-induced dysfunction by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and increasing nitric oxide (NO) production via eNOS phosphorylation.39  
In the context of cardiovascular health, AS-IV inhibits cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by blocking the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. It also improves mitochondrial bioenergetics by regulating calcium homeostasis; it inhibits the calcium overload induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury by modulating the Na+/K+ ATPase and SERCA pumps. This preservation of mitochondrial integrity prevents apoptosis and supports energy metabolism in high-demand tissues like the heart and brain. Furthermore, AS-IV promotes angiogenesis via the VEGF/KDR pathway, improving microcirculation in aged tissues.41

### **12\. Gynostemma (Gypenosides)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Metabolism; Energy; Recovery |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Deregulated Nutrient Sensing; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Gynostemma pentaphyllum, often called "Southern Ginseng," contains a vast array of dammarane-type saponins known as gypenosides, some of which are identical to ginsenosides (e.g., Rb1, Rd). The primary geroprotective mechanism of Gynostemma is the potent, biphasic activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as the cellular energy sensor; its activation by gypenosides signals a low-energy state, triggering catabolic pathways like fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake (via GLUT4 translocation) while inhibiting anabolic pathways like lipogenesis (via ACC inhibition).43  
This AMPK activation also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis through the PGC-1α pathway and promotes autophagy via mTOR inhibition, directly addressing Deregulated Nutrient Sensing and Mitochondrial Dysfunction. Gypenosides have also been shown to activate SIRT1, linking metabolic regulation to epigenetic stability. Furthermore, Gynostemma exhibits "adaptogenic" properties by modulating the Nrf2 pathway to enhance endogenous antioxidant defenses (SOD, Catalase) during stress, while simultaneously suppressing NF-κB mediated inflammation. This dual action helps maintain homeostasis in the face of metabolic and environmental stressors.43

### **13\. Echinacea**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Immunity; Recovery |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Dysbiosis; Chronic Inflammation; Altered Intercellular Communication; Stem Cell Exhaustion |

Geek Mode:  
Echinacea purpurea's bioactivity is largely attributed to its alkylamides (alkamides), polysaccharides, and caffeic acid derivatives. The alkylamides are structurally similar to anandamide and act as ligands for the Cannabinoid Receptor Type 2 (CB2). Activation of CB2 receptors on immune cells (macrophages, T-cells) modulates the immune response, enhancing phagocytosis and the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) while suppressing pro-inflammatory ones (TNF-α) under certain conditions. This immunomodulation helps resolve infections and regulate Chronic Inflammation.46  
Crucially, Echinacea has been shown to stimulate hematopoiesis—the formation of new blood cells. It induces the secretion of erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-3 (IL-3) from stromal cells. These growth factors promote the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, addressing Stem Cell Exhaustion. This mechanism suggests Echinacea can support the replenishment of the immune system and red blood cell pool, particularly in aging or stress-induced myelosuppression.48

### **14\. Astragalus (Whole Root)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Immunity; Energy; Recovery |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Telomere Attrition; Stem Cell Exhaustion; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
While isolated compounds like Astragaloside IV and Cycloastragenol have specific targets, the whole Astragalus root provides a synergistic matrix of saponins, flavonoids (like calycosin and formononetin), and polysaccharides (APS). The whole root extract exerts a broader "tonic" effect. The flavonoids are potent antioxidants that scavenge ROS and improve endothelial function. The polysaccharides are the primary immunomodulators, enhancing the activity of B-cells and T-cells. The synergy allows for simultaneous support of immune surveillance, metabolic regulation (via PPAR-gamma modulation), and kidney protection (anti-fibrotic). This holistic action supports the "Integrative Hallmarks" of aging, particularly Altered Intercellular Communication and Stem Cell Exhaustion, by maintaining the microenvironment required for healthy tissue turnover.33

### **15\. Cacao (Flavanols)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Cognition; Focus; Energy |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Chronic Inflammation; Loss of Proteostasis; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Altered Intercellular Communication |

Geek Mode:  
Cacao is a potent source of flavan-3-ols, particularly (-)-epicatechin. The defining mechanism of epicatechin is the stimulation of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), leading to increased production of Nitric Oxide (NO). NO is a key signaling molecule that induces vasodilation, improving blood flow and endothelial function throughout the body, including the brain (neurovascular coupling). This enhanced perfusion supports oxygen and glucose delivery to neurons, critical for maintaining cognitive function and synaptic plasticity.50  
Beyond vascular effects, epicatechin crosses the blood-brain barrier and directly modulates signaling pathways involved in learning and memory. It enhances the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) via the ERK/CREB pathway, promoting neurogenesis and synaptic growth. Cacao flavanols also improve insulin sensitivity by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway in skeletal muscle, linking metabolic health to cognitive resilience. Furthermore, they exhibit antioxidant properties that protect mitochondria from oxidative stress and reduce neuroinflammation by inhibiting glial activation.52

### **16\. Gotu Kola (*Centella asiatica*)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Cognition; Recovery; Metabolism |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Loss of Proteostasis; Stem Cell Exhaustion; Altered Intercellular Communication; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
Gotu Kola is renowned for its triterpenoid saponins: asiaticoside, madecassoside, and their aglycones (asiatic acid, madecassic acid). These compounds are master regulators of connective tissue. They stimulate the synthesis of collagen type I and fibronectin by activating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in fibroblasts. This mechanism accelerates wound healing, strengthens the skin matrix (reversing Loss of Proteostasis in the ECM), and improves venous tone/microcirculation. In the brain, these triterpenes exhibit neurotrophic activity.54  
Specifically, asiaticoside and asiatic acid have been shown to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of CREB and the subsequent upregulation of BDNF expression. This promotes neurite outgrowth and protects neurons from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress or beta-amyloid toxicity. Gotu Kola also mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring the activity of mitochondrial enzymes (Complex I, II, IV) and reducing lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, it acts on neural stem cells, promoting their proliferation and differentiation, which addresses Stem Cell Exhaustion in the neurogenic niches.55

### **17\. Pterostilbene**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Cognition; Metabolism; Recovery |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Epigenetic Alterations; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Loss of Proteostasis; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
Pterostilbene is a dimethylated analog of resveratrol found in blueberries. The presence of two methoxy groups dramatically increases its lipophilicity and membrane permeability, resulting in significantly higher oral bioavailability (approx. 80%) and a longer half-life compared to resveratrol. Once intracellular, pterostilbene acts as a potent activator of the SIRT1 enzyme (mimicking caloric restriction) and the AMPK pathway. This leads to the deacetylation of PGC-1α and FOXO factors, driving mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant gene expression.57  
A key distinction is Pterostilbene's potent activation of the Nrf2 pathway, which upregulates Phase II detoxification enzymes like heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione peroxidase more effectively than resveratrol in some models. It also inhibits the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and enzymes (COX-2, iNOS). In the brain, pterostilbene improves calcium homeostasis and modulates the release of neurotransmitters (dopamine, acetylcholine), leading to enhanced cognitive performance and protection against neurodegeneration.59

### **18\. Polydatin**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Metabolism; Recovery; Energy |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Epigenetic Alterations; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Chronic Inflammation; Loss of Proteostasis |

Geek Mode:  
Polydatin is the natural glucoside precursor of resveratrol (resveratrol-3-O-β-mono-D-glucoside). The glucose moiety protects the stilbene structure from rapid oxidation and enzymatic degradation in the gut, potentially offering a different bioavailability profile than resveratrol. Polydatin enters cells via active glucose transport mechanisms (SGLT1) and can be hydrolyzed to resveratrol or act directly. It functions as a potent antioxidant, blocking the malondialdehyde (MDA) pathway and scavenging ROS to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage. It preserves mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibits the opening of the mPTP.61  
Polydatin strongly activates the SIRT1/Nrf2 axis, enhancing cellular antioxidant defenses. It is particularly effective in lipid metabolism, where it regulates the expression of PPAR-α and SREBP-1c, promoting fatty acid oxidation and inhibiting lipogenesis. This modulation helps prevent hepatic steatosis and improves insulin sensitivity. Additionally, Polydatin has been shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that drives inflammation in response to danger signals, thereby reducing IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and addressing Chronic Inflammation.62

### **19\. L-Theanine**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Calm; Focus; Sleep |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Altered Intercellular Communication; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
L-Theanine (N-ethyl-L-glutamine) is a non-protein amino acid found in tea leaves. It crosses the blood-brain barrier via the leucine-preferring transport system. Structurally similar to glutamate, it binds to glutamate receptors (AMPA, Kainate, NMDA) but acts as a competitive antagonist, preventing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Its most profound effect is the modulation of inhibitory neurotransmitters; it increases the levels of GABA, dopamine, and glycine in the brain. This shift in neurochemistry promotes the generation of alpha brain waves (8–12 Hz), inducing a state of "relaxed alertness" without sedation.64  
L-Theanine also exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the downregulation of GABA(A) receptors during stress. It acts as an antioxidant, mitigating oxidative damage in neuronal cells. Furthermore, it interacts with the glutamate transporter (GLT-1), preventing the accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Studies suggest it can ameliorate sleep quality by reducing sympathetic nervous system activation and lowering cortisol levels. By optimizing neurotransmitter balance, it improves Altered Intercellular Communication in neural circuits.66

### **20\. Milk Thistle Extract (Silymarin)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Recovery; Metabolism; Immunity |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Loss of Proteostasis; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Chronic Inflammation; Genomic Instability |

Geek Mode:  
Silymarin is a complex of flavonolignans (silybin, silychristin, silydianin) derived from Silybum marianum. Silybin is the most biologically active component. Its primary mechanism is hepatoprotection via membrane stabilization; it prevents the uptake of toxins (like phalloidin or amanitin) by blocking specific transport proteins (OATPs) on the hepatocyte membrane. Intracellularly, silymarin stimulates RNA Polymerase I activity, increasing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. This boosts the ribosome pool and enhances protein synthesis, accelerating the regeneration of damaged liver tissue (reversing Loss of Proteostasis).68  
Silymarin acts as a potent antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and increasing intracellular Glutathione (GSH) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) levels. It inhibits the NF-κB pathway and the 5-LOX enzyme, reducing hepatic inflammation. Furthermore, it exerts anti-fibrotic effects by blocking the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, which prevents the transformation of hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblasts. This multi-targeted approach preserves liver function, which is central to systemic detoxification and metabolic regulation in aging.70

### **21\. Vitamin C**

| Feature | Detail |

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Genomic Instability; Loss of Proteostasis; Chronic Inflammation; Stem Cell Exhaustion |

Geek Mode:  
Beyond its well-known role as a water-soluble antioxidant (scavenging ROS), Vitamin C (ascorbate) acts as an essential cofactor for a family of Fe2+ and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Most notably, it is required for the activity of Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes (TET1/2/3). TET enzymes catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a key step in active DNA demethylation. By enhancing TET activity, Vitamin C maintains the epigenetic landscape, preventing the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and maintaining stem cell pluripotency (Epigenetic Alterations/Stem Cell Exhaustion).72  
Vitamin C is also a cofactor for collagen prolyl hydroxylases, enzymes essential for the formation of the collagen triple helix structure. This ensures the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in skin, blood vessels, and bone. In the context of reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), Vitamin C alleviates senescence by downregulating p53/p21 via H3K36 demethylation. It creates a permissive epigenetic state for cellular rejuvenation. Furthermore, high-dose Vitamin C can selectively kill cancer cells with KRAS/BRAF mutations by inducing oxidative stress via the accumulation of DHA (dehydroascorbate) and subsequent glutathione depletion.74

### **22\. Phosphatidylserine (PS)**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Cognition; Focus; Calm |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Altered Intercellular Communication; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Loss of Proteostasis; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an anionic phospholipid normally localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by enzymes called flippases. It plays a critical role in cell signaling as a scaffold for proteins like Protein Kinase C (PKC) and Raf-1 kinase, which are involved in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. During apoptosis, PS is exposed on the outer leaflet, serving as an "eat me" signal for macrophages (efferocytosis), a key process in resolving inflammation without tissue damage. In the aging brain, PS levels decline, leading to reduced membrane fluidity and impaired neurotransmitter receptor function.76  
Supplementation with PS restores membrane fluidity and supports the release of acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. It has been shown to blunt the exercise-induced cortisol response by modulating the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, promoting a favorable testosterone-to-cortisol ratio. Additionally, PS supports mitochondrial membrane integrity (cardiolipin interactions) and prevents age-related dendritic spine loss in the hippocampus, preserving cognitive function and memory consolidation.78

### **23\. 5-HTP**

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Altered Intercellular Communication; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is the direct metabolic precursor to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). Unlike L-tryptophan, 5-HTP is not incorporated into proteins, nor is it shunted into the kynurenine pathway (which can produce neurotoxic metabolites). 5-HTP freely crosses the blood-brain barrier and is decarboxylated by the enzyme Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AAAD) to form serotonin. This pathway effectively bypasses the rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, ensuring robust serotonin synthesis even when that enzyme is downregulated by stress or inflammation.80  
Elevated serotonin levels modulate mood, appetite, and pain perception. Crucially, serotonin serves as the precursor for melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) in the pineal gland. By supporting the serotonin pool, 5-HTP indirectly enhances melatonin production, regulating the circadian rhythm and sleep architecture. It has been shown to increase REM sleep duration. Additionally, serotonin receptors (5-HT receptors) modulate the release of other neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine, influencing global neural network stability and reducing anxiety.82

Geek Mode:  
Kava (Piper methysticum) derives its effects from a class of lactones called kavalactones (e.g., kavain, methysticin, dihydrokavain). These lipophilic molecules modulate the GABAA receptor, enhancing the binding of GABA and potentiating chloride ion influx. However, unlike benzodiazepines, kavalactones likely bind to a distinct site on the receptor, resulting in anxiolysis without significant sedation or cognitive impairment at lower doses. Kavalactones also block voltage-gated sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) channels, inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release (glutamate) and dampening neuronal firing rates.84  
Furthermore, Kava inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and reversibly inhibits Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B), leading to increased levels of these neurotransmitters and potential mood elevation. Kava has also been shown to activate the Nrf2 pathway, upregulating antioxidant enzymes, and to inhibit the NF-κB pathway, reducing neuroinflammation. This multifaceted pharmacology makes it a unique modulator of Altered Intercellular Communication in stress-related disorders.86

Geek Mode:  
Rhodiola Rosea is a classic adaptogen, with its effects mediated primarily by phenylpropanoids (rosavins) and phenylethanoids (salidroside). Its hallmark mechanism is the modulation of the HPA axis; it inhibits the excessive release of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) and lowers cortisol levels during chronic stress, preventing "adrenal burnout." At the cellular level, Salidroside activates the AMPK pathway, stimulating glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells, similar to exercise. It also upregulates the expression of Heat Shock Proteins (HSP70), which act as molecular chaperones to prevent protein aggregation (Loss of Proteostasis).88  
Rhodiola acts as a mild mitochondrial uncoupler, improving the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation while reducing superoxide generation. It inhibits Monoamine Oxidases A and B (MAO-A/B), increasing the synaptic availability of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain. This leads to improved mood, focus, and cognitive function under fatigue. Additionally, Rhodiola stimulates the expression of SIRT1 and activates the FOXO defense pathway, promoting stress resistance and longevity in model organisms.90

### **26\. Taurine**

Geek Mode:  
Taurine is a unique, sulfur-containing beta-amino acid that exists free in the cytosol. Its most critical role in aging is the modification of mitochondrial tRNA. Taurine forms a conjugate with the uridine wobble base of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR). This taurine modification is essential for the precise codon-anticodon interaction during the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, specifically subunits of Complex I (ND6). A deficiency in taurine leads to defective protein synthesis, ETC dysfunction, and increased ROS generation ("mitochondrial translation fidelity").92  
Taurine supplementation restores this modification, improving mitochondrial respiratory capacity and reducing oxidative stress. It also acts as an osmolyte, regulating cell volume, and modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis by inhibiting the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, protecting against calcium overload and apoptosis. Taurine has been shown to reduce Cellular Senescence by inhibiting the p53/p21 pathway and suppressing DNA damage. In large-scale studies, taurine supplementation extended the healthspan and lifespan of mice and monkeys, improving bone density, muscle strength, and metabolic markers.94

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Loss of Proteostasis; Disabled Macroautophagy; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
EGCG is the most abundant and bioactive catechin in green tea. It functions as a potent inducer of autophagy. Mechanistically, EGCG activates the CaMKKβ/AMPK signaling pathway. Activated AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits mTORC1 (the master inhibitor of autophagy) and directly phosphorylates ULK1 (the initiator of autophagy), thereby triggering the formation of autophagosomes. This process facilitates the clearance of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles (lipophagy/mitophagy).96  
EGCG also acts as a "senomorphic" agent; while not strictly a senolytic that kills cells, it suppresses the SASP (Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype) by inhibiting the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways. It specifically binds to the 67 kDa Laminin Receptor (67LR) on cell surfaces, mediating anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, EGCG can directly interact with misfolded proteins (like amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein), remodeling them into non-toxic aggregates, thus protecting against neurotoxicity and Loss of Proteostasis.98

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Disabled Macroautophagy; Loss of Proteostasis; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Spermidine is a natural polyamine that is a critical caloric restriction mimetic. Its primary mechanism is the induction of autophagy via the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300. EP300 normally inhibits autophagy by acetylating key autophagy proteins (like ATG5, ATG7, LC3). Spermidine suppresses EP300, keeping these proteins in a deacetylated, active state. It also activates AMPK and inhibits mTORC1, reinforcing the autophagic flux. This clearance of cellular debris is vital for cardiac and neuronal health.100  
A unique and crucial mechanism of spermidine is the hypusination of the translation factor eIF5A. Spermidine provides the aminobutyl group for the post-translational modification of eIF5A. Hypusinated eIF5A is essential for the translation of proteins containing polyproline motifs, which includes many proteins involved in autophagy (like TFEB) and mitochondrial respiration. By maintaining eIF5A hypusination, spermidine preserves mitochondrial function and protein synthesis fidelity in aging B-cells and neurons, reversing immunosenescence and cognitive decline.102

Geek Mode:  
Lion's Mane mushroom contains two distinct classes of neurotrophic compounds: Hericenones (found in the fruiting body) and Erinacines (found in the mycelium). These small molecules (diterpenoids) can cross the blood-brain barrier. They stimulate the synthesis of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in astrocytes and neurons. NGF/BDNF binding to TrkA/TrkB receptors activates the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways, which promotes neurite outgrowth, branching, and synaptogenesis.103  
This neurotrophic support is critical for maintaining synaptic density and plasticity (Altered Intercellular Communication) and protecting neurons from apoptosis. Lion's Mane also reduces neuroinflammation by inhibiting the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in microglia. In models of Alzheimer's disease, it has been shown to reduce amyloid-beta plaque burden and prevent cognitive impairment, potentially by enhancing the degradation of Aβ via increased expression of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE).105

Geek Mode:  
Hydrolyzed collagen peptides, specifically those rich in Proline-Hydroxyproline (Pro-Hyp) and Hydroxyproline-Glycine (Hyp-Gly) dipeptides, are absorbed intact into the circulation. These dipeptides act as signaling molecules. They bind to cell surface receptors (like integrins) on fibroblasts, triggering intracellular signaling cascades that stimulate the synthesis of new collagen fibrils, elastin, and hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix (ECM). This combats the age-related fragmentation of the collagen network (Loss of Proteostasis in the ECM).107  
Furthermore, collagen peptides inhibit the expression and activity of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), the enzymes responsible for breaking down collagen, particularly MMP-1 and MMP-3. They also suppress inflammation by downregulating NF-κB activity in chondrocytes and skin cells. By restoring the mechanical properties of the ECM, collagen peptides improve skin elasticity and joint function. They may also support Stem Cell Exhaustion by maintaining the structural niche required for stem cell quiescence and activation.109

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Chronic Inflammation; Deregulated Nutrient Sensing; Altered Intercellular Communication; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Holy Basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) functions as an adaptogen primarily through its active compounds like eugenol, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. Its key mechanism is the modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, reducing the secretion of cortisol during stress. It inhibits the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol, thereby lowering intracellular cortisol levels. This protects neurons and other tissues from the deleterious effects of chronic glucocorticoid exposure.111  
Holy Basil also exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the COX-2 and LOX-5 enzymes. It improves Deregulated Nutrient Sensing by enhancing insulin secretion and sensitivity, possibly via PPAR-gamma activation. In the CNS, it modulates neurotransmitters, antagonizing the stress-induced changes in serotonin and dopamine levels. Additionally, it boosts endogenous antioxidant defenses (SOD, Catalase) via Nrf2 activation, protecting against heavy metal toxicity and radiation injury.113

### **32\. Magnolia Bark Extract**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Calm; Sleep; Recovery |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Altered Intercellular Communication; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence; Loss of Proteostasis |

Geek Mode:  
Magnolia bark is a source of two neolignans: Honokiol and Magnolol. These compounds are positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, enhancing chloride influx and promoting neuronal inhibition (anxiolysis/sedation) without the side effects of benzodiazepines. Magnolol also acts as a partial agonist at Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2), which contributes to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Both compounds inhibit the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways, suppressing neuroinflammation and cytokine release.115  
Honokiol, specifically, activates SIRT3 in the mitochondria. SIRT3 deacetylation of mitochondrial enzymes (like SOD2) enhances oxidative stress resistance and metabolic flexibility. This mitochondrial protection is vital for preventing neuronal death (Loss of Proteostasis). Furthermore, Magnolia extracts reduce corticosterone levels, dampening the stress response. They act as "senomorphics" by inhibiting the SASP, thus reducing the systemic inflammatory burden of aging.117

### **33\. Urolithin A**

| **Functional Outcomes** | Energy; Recovery; Metabolism |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Disabled Macroautophagy; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Loss of Proteostasis; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Urolithin A (UA) is a gut metabolite of ellagitannins (from pomegranates/nuts) that acts as a potent activator of mitophagy, the selective recycling of damaged mitochondria. UA stabilizes PINK1 on the outer membrane of defective mitochondria, which recruits Parkin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase). Parkin ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins, flagging the organelle for engulfment by autophagosomes. This clears dysfunctional mitochondria that would otherwise leak ROS and trigger inflammasomes.119  
UA also activates AMPK and inhibits mTORC1, further promoting autophagic flux. In skeletal muscle, this mechanism restores mitochondrial quality, improving muscle strength and endurance (reversing sarcopenia). In the brain, UA-mediated mitophagy reduces neuroinflammation and protects against proteinopathies (like Alzheimer's). It also improves gut barrier function by enhancing tight junction protein expression via the Nrf2 pathway. UA represents a direct intervention to restore "Mitochondrial Quality Control".120

### **34\. Trehalose**

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Loss of Proteostasis; Disabled Macroautophagy; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Trehalose is a disaccharide that functions as a chemical chaperone and an mTOR-independent autophagy inducer. As a chaperone, it directly stabilizes protein structures, preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins (like huntingtin, tau, and alpha-synuclein) by replacing water molecules and forming a protective "glass-like" matrix around the protein. This preserves native conformation under stress conditions (Loss of Proteostasis).123  
Mechanistically, trehalose induces autophagy by inhibiting the SLC2A (GLUT) glucose transporters. This inhibition creates a state of pseudo-starvation that activates AMPK and phosphorylates ULK1, initiating autophagy without suppressing mTORC1 directly. It also promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB (Transcription Factor EB), the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy genes. This enhances the lysosomal capacity to degrade cellular debris. Trehalose's ability to clear aggregates makes it a promising candidate for neurodegenerative diseases.125

### **35\. Curcumin**

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Chronic Inflammation; Loss of Proteostasis; Genomic Instability; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Curcumin is a polyphenol with pleiotropic effects. Its primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is the inhibition of IκB kinase (IKK). By blocking IKK, curcumin prevents the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, thereby keeping the NF-κB transcription factor sequestered in the cytoplasm. This halts the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6). Curcumin also activates the Nrf2 pathway, upregulating antioxidant enzymes (HO-1, SOD) to combat oxidative stress.127  
Curcumin binds directly to amyloid-beta fibrils, inhibiting their aggregation and promoting disaggregation (Loss of Proteostasis). It modulates the mTOR pathway (inhibition) and activates Sirtuins, linking it to autophagy induction and lifespan extension. However, native curcumin has poor bioavailability; formulations using liposomes, piperine, or nanoparticles are often required to achieve therapeutic plasma levels. It acts as a senolytic or senomorphic depending on the context, clearing senescent cells or dampening their SASP.129

### **36\. Rapamycin**

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Deregulated Nutrient Sensing; Disabled Macroautophagy; Cellular Senescence; Loss of Proteostasis |

Geek Mode:  
Rapamycin is the most robust pharmacological geroprotector currently known. It acts as an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1 (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1). Rapamycin binds to the intracellular protein FKBP12, and this complex binds to the mTOR kinase, destabilizing it. Inhibition of mTORC1 mimics nutrient scarcity, halting anabolic processes (like protein synthesis via S6K1) and activating catabolic repair processes, primarily macroautophagy. The release of mTORC1 inhibition on the ULK1 complex triggers the formation of autophagosomes, clearing damaged proteins and organelles.131  
Rapamycin also suppresses the translation of specific mRNAs involved in the SASP (like IL-6 and IL-1β) by inhibiting the MAPKAPK2 pathway, thus reducing systemic inflammation ("inflammaging"). It preserves stem cell function by preventing hyper-proliferation and exhaustion (Stem Cell Exhaustion). Intermittent dosing is often used to minimize side effects (like glucose intolerance from mTORC2 inhibition) while maximizing the anti-aging benefits of mTORC1 suppression. It extends lifespan in every model organism tested.133

### **37\. Chaga Mushroom**

Geek Mode:  
Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) is a dense source of polyphenols, melanin, and triterpenoids (betulin/betulinic acid). Its melanin complex mimics Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), directly neutralizing superoxide radicals and protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage. Betulinic acid exerts selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells by inducing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (apoptosis) while sparing healthy cells. Chaga polysaccharides (beta-glucans) modulate the immune system via TLR receptors and improve gut barrier integrity.135  
Chaga extracts powerfully inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway, suppressing the expression of inflammatory mediators like NO, PGE2, and cytokines. This makes it effective in managing colitis and other inflammatory conditions. It also regulates the Nrf2 pathway, boosting endogenous antioxidant defenses. In the context of viral infections, Chaga components can block viral entry (e.g., preventing Spike protein binding) and inhibit viral replication proteases.137

### **38\. Urolithin B**

Geek Mode:  
Urolithin B (Uro B) is another gut metabolite of ellagitannins, distinct from Urolithin A in its specific anabolic effects on muscle. Uro B has been shown to bind to the androgen receptor (AR) in myotubes. This activation enhances protein synthesis via the mTORC1 signaling pathway (independent of insulin) and simultaneously represses the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), specifically downregulating atrogin-1 and MuRF1 (E3 ligases involved in muscle atrophy). This shifts the balance towards muscle hypertrophy.139  
While Uro A focuses on mitophagy, Uro B focuses on muscle mass preservation and growth. It promotes the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes and protects against muscle wasting induced by denervation or stress (like dexamethasone). Uro B also supports mitochondrial function, likely via AMPK modulation, but its unique value proposition lies in its ability to rescue muscle mass in sarcopenic or cachectic states via AR-mediated signaling.141

Geek Mode:  
Tremella fuciformis polysaccharides (TFPS) are massive molecules that function primarily as potent hydrators and antioxidants. They have a water-retention capacity superior to hyaluronic acid. Mechanistically, TFPS promotes the expression of SIRT1 in skin fibroblasts. SIRT1 activation deacetylates FOXO3a, increasing the transcription of antioxidant enzymes (SOD2, Catalase) and protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (H2O2 injury). This preserves skin structure and delays senescence.143  
TFPS also modulates the immune system by binding to macrophage receptors (TLR4), triggering the release of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) that enhance innate immunity. In the gut, they act as prebiotics, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria and Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Additionally, TFPS inhibits the NF-κB pathway in macrophages, reducing excessive inflammatory responses. This dual hydration and cytoprotection make it a key molecule for "beauty from within" and barrier integrity.145

Geek Mode:  
Tart cherries are rich in anthocyanins (like cyanidin-3-glucoside) and contain natural melatonin. The anthocyanins function as dual inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, similar to NSAIDs but without the gastrointestinal side effects. This suppression of prostaglandin synthesis reduces pain and inflammation after exercise. Crucially, tart cherry polyphenols inhibit the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO degrades tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway (often upregulated in aging/inflammation). By inhibiting IDO, tart cherries spare tryptophan for serotonin and melatonin synthesis.147  
This mechanism, combined with the exogenous melatonin content, significantly improves sleep efficiency and duration. Tart cherries also lower uric acid levels by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, preventing gout flares. They enhance mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress markers (like F2-isoprostanes) systemically. The reduction in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CRP) further supports recovery and reduces the "inflammaging" burden.147

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Deregulated Nutrient Sensing; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Epigenetic Alterations; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG) is a key intermediate in the Krebs cycle. Ca-AKG acts as an obligate cofactor for Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes (DNA demethylation) and Jumonji C-domain containing histone demethylases (JHDMs). By fueling these enzymes, AKG maintains the "epigenetic landscape," preventing the hypermethylation drift characteristic of aging (Epigenetic Alterations). Supplementation has been shown to reverse biological age as measured by DNA methylation clocks.151  
AKG also inhibits the ATP synthase subunit (specifically the alpha subunit), which lowers ATP levels slightly and inhibits the mTOR pathway, mimicking caloric restriction. This induces autophagy and extends lifespan in *C. elegans* and mice. Furthermore, AKG bridges cellular energy metabolism with amino acid homeostasis (glutamate/glutamine conversion) and detoxifies ammonia. In humans, Ca-AKG reduces inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-6) and improves frailty scores, compressing morbidity.153

Geek Mode:  
Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body that serves as an efficient alternative fuel for the brain and heart, bypassing glucose metabolism defects (insulin resistance). However, its signaling role is paramount. BHB acts as an endogenous inhibitor of Class I Histone Deacetylases (HDACs). This inhibition increases histone acetylation (e.g., at the FOXO3a promoter), activating genes involved in oxidative stress resistance and longevity. This epigenetic modification protects cells from oxidative damage.155  
BHB also binds to the HCAR2 receptor (GPR109A) on immune cells, blocking the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This prevents the processing and release of IL-1β and IL-18, significantly dampening sterile inflammation and neuroinflammation. Metabolically, BHB oxidation increases the ratio of acetyl-CoA/succinyl-CoA and alters the NAD+/NADH ratio, influencing mitochondrial thermodynamics and reducing ROS generation. It is a key mediator of the benefits of fasting and ketogenic diets.157

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Genomic Instability; Epigenetic Alterations; Deregulated Nutrient Sensing |

Geek Mode:  
Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) is a nucleoside precursor to NAD+. Unlike Nicotinamide (NAM), NR utilizes specific kinases (NRK1/2) to bypass the rate-limiting enzyme NAMPT in the NAD+ salvage pathway. This allows for rapid replenishment of intracellular NAD+ pools, which decline with age. Elevated NAD+ activates Sirtuins (SIRT1/3), which deacetylate mitochondrial proteins (like SOD2 and IDH2), enhancing oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and antioxidant defense (Mitochondrial Dysfunction).159  
NR also supports PARP activity, essential for DNA repair (Genomic Instability). In stem cells, NR restores mitochondrial function and prevents senescence, rejuvenating muscle and neural stem cell populations (Stem Cell Exhaustion). NR has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's models by normalizing the NAD+/NADH ratio and reducing Aβ toxicity. It effectively re-energizes the cell's metabolic machinery.161

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Deregulated Nutrient Sensing; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
Metformin's primary molecular action is the mild, transient inhibition of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This reduces ATP production and increases the AMP/ATP ratio. The energy deficit is sensed by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which becomes phosphorylated and active. Activated AMPK inhibits mTORC1 (via TSC2), suppresses lipogenesis (via ACC), and promotes glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. This shift from anabolism to catabolism mimics the longevity effects of caloric restriction.163  
Metformin also inhibits mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis. Beyond metabolism, it acts as a "senomorphic" by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, which suppresses the secretion of pro-inflammatory SASP factors from senescent cells without necessarily killing them. Metformin enhances autophagy and improving protein folding (Loss of Proteostasis). It also modulates the gut microbiota, increasing short-chain fatty acid producers, which contributes to its metabolic benefits.165

Geek Mode:  
Resveratrol is a stilbenoid polyphenol that acts as an allosteric activator of SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase. Binding of resveratrol induces a conformational change in SIRT1, enhancing its affinity for substrates. Activated SIRT1 deacetylates PGC-1α (driving mitochondrial biogenesis) and FOXO proteins (enhancing stress resistance). It also inhibits phosphodiesterases (PDEs), increasing cAMP levels, which activates the CamKKβ-AMPK pathway. This convergent activation of SIRT1 and AMPK improves metabolic flexibility.59  
Resveratrol reduces inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB and AP-1 signaling. In the vasculature, it stimulates eNOS, increasing nitric oxide production and improving endothelial function. However, its low oral bioavailability is a limitation, often requiring high doses or advanced delivery systems. Resveratrol also modulates autophagy and clears protein aggregates (like amyloid-beta), protecting against neurodegeneration (Loss of Proteostasis).58

Geek Mode:  
Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant endogenous antioxidant, a tripeptide (Glu-Cys-Gly). Its sulfhydryl group acts as a reducing equivalent for Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) enzymes, which detoxify hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides. GSH is critical for maintaining the intracellular redox state; a decline in the GSH/GSSG ratio triggers apoptosis. GSH also forms conjugates with xenobiotics via Glutathione S-Transferases (GSTs), facilitating their excretion (Phase II detoxification).168  
Direct oral supplementation of GSH faces challenges with bioavailability due to intestinal peptidase breakdown. However, liposomal forms or sublingual delivery can bypass this. Intracellularly, GSH protects telomeres from oxidative attrition and prevents protein oxidation (glutathionylation). It is essential for T-cell proliferation and function (Immunity). Mitochondrial GSH is distinct from the cytosolic pool and is vital for preventing mPTP opening and cell death.170

Geek Mode:  
Myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) serve as precursors for Inositol Phosphoglycans (IPGs), which act as secondary messengers for insulin. MI-IPGs activate transporters for glucose uptake, while DCI-IPGs stimulate glycogen synthase. This mechanism sensitizes cells to insulin, combatting insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (Deregulated Nutrient Sensing). In the ovary, the MI:DCI ratio regulates FSH signaling and androgen production, critical for fertility and PCOS management.172  
In the brain, inositol is a precursor for the phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle. This cycle generates secondary messengers like IP3 and DAG, which mediate signal transduction for serotonin (5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors. By supporting these signaling pathways, inositol modulates mood and anxiety. It also regulates intracellular calcium release via IP3 receptors, influencing neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Altered Intercellular Communication).174

Geek Mode:  
ZMA is a synergistic formulation of Zinc Monomethionine Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, and Vitamin B6. The aspartate chelation enhances mineral bioavailability. Zinc plays a pivotal role in testosterone synthesis and prevents the conversion of testosterone to estradiol (aromatase inhibition). It is also crucial for IGF-1 production (anabolic signaling). Magnesium acts as a cofactor for ATP synthase and regulates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting muscle relaxation and sleep depth (slow-wave sleep).176  
Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is essential for the enzymatic conversion of 5-HTP to serotonin and subsequently to melatonin, regulating the sleep-wake cycle. The combination addresses common micronutrient deficiencies in athletes that lead to a catabolic hormonal profile (high cortisol, low testosterone). By optimizing the anabolic hormonal environment and sleep architecture, ZMA supports tissue repair and muscle recovery.178

Geek Mode:  
Creatine (methylguanidine-acetic acid) functions as a high-energy phosphate buffer. It is phosphorylated to phosphocreatine (PCr) by creatine kinase. During intense metabolic demand, PCr donates its phosphate to ADP to rapidly regenerate ATP, buffering cellular energy levels. This "spatial energy shuttle" is critical in skeletal muscle and the brain. Creatine stabilizes the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by binding to the creatine kinase octamer in the intermembrane space, preventing apoptosis and ROS leakage (Mitochondrial Dysfunction).180  
In the brain, creatine supplementation improves cognitive processing speed and memory by ensuring ATP availability for ion pumps and neurotransmitter release. It acts as a direct antioxidant against peroxynitrite. Creatine also reduces the accumulation of lipofuscin (age pigment) and supports satellite cell differentiation in muscle, aiding in regeneration and preventing sarcopenia (Stem Cell Exhaustion). It modulates the GABA-A receptor, potentially contributing to mood regulation.182

Geek Mode:  
PQQ is a redox cofactor that stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis more potently than many other compounds. It activates the CREB/PGC-1α pathway. PQQ stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB, which then increases PGC-1α promoter activity. PGC-1α is the master regulator that drives the transcription of Nuclear Respiratory Factors (NRF-1/2) and TFAM (Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A), leading to mitochondrial DNA replication and organelle proliferation (Mitochondrial Dysfunction).184  
PQQ is also an exceptionally potent antioxidant, capable of catalyzing thousands of redox cycles (neutralizing ROS) before being depleted. It protects mitochondria from oxidative damage. PQQ promotes the synthesis of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in astrocytes, supporting neuronal survival and repair. It has been shown to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein proteins (Loss of Proteostasis) and modulate the JAK/STAT pathway to reduce inflammation.185

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Loss of Proteostasis; Genomic Instability; Chronic Inflammation |

Geek Mode:  
Methylene Blue (MB) acts as an alternative electron transporter in the mitochondria. It has a redox potential that allows it to accept electrons from NADH (bypassing Complex I) and FADH2, and donate them directly to Cytochrome C (Complex IV). This bypass mechanism maintains ATP production even when Complex I is dysfunctional (a common aging phenotype) or blocked. By facilitating electron flow, MB reduces electron leakage and superoxide formation, effectively acting as a mitochondrial antioxidant.187  
MB exhibits a hormetic dose-response; low doses enhance respiration and memory, while high doses can be inhibitory. It induces mitophagy and upregulates antioxidant enzymes (Nrf2 pathway). MB prevents the aggregation of tau protein (neurofibrillary tangles) and amyloid-beta by oxidizing cysteine residues, preventing polymerization (Loss of Proteostasis). It also acts as a monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor, increasing catecholamine levels for cognitive enhancement.189

Geek Mode:  
ALCAR facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation (the carnitine shuttle). Uniquely, the acetyl group of ALCAR can be donated to Coenzyme A to form Acetyl-CoA, bypassing the requirement for glucose-derived pyruvate. This Acetyl-CoA feeds the Krebs cycle for ATP production and serves as a substrate for the acetylation of proteins (including histones) and the synthesis of acetylcholine (neurotransmitter). ALCAR restores the cardiolipin content of the inner mitochondrial membrane, improving ETC efficiency.191  
ALCAR enhances the expression of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and its receptor (TrkA), promoting neurite outgrowth. It protects against neurotoxicity and improves synaptic plasticity. By optimizing fatty acid metabolism, it prevents the accumulation of toxic lipid intermediates. ALCAR supplementation reverses age-related declines in mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces oxidative stress in the brain and heart.193

Geek Mode:  
Astaxanthin is a keto-carotenoid with a unique molecular structure that allows it to span the entire cell membrane bilayer. Its polar end groups anchor in the membrane surface while the polyene chain spans the hydrophobic core. This positioning allows it to scavenge radicals at both the surface and interior of the membrane, stabilizing the bilayer against lipid peroxidation. It protects the mitochondrial membrane potential, preserving ATP production efficiency (Mitochondrial Dysfunction).195  
Astaxanthin inhibits the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6). It activates the Nrf2/ARE pathway, boosting endogenous antioxidant enzymes (HO-1, NQO1). Unlike other antioxidants, astaxanthin never becomes a pro-oxidant. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier, providing potent neuroprotection and protecting eyes from UV-induced damage and age-related macular degeneration.197

Geek Mode:  
Coenzyme Q10 serves as the obligate electron carrier between Complex I/II and Complex III in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is essential for the generation of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. Its reduced form, Ubiquinol, is a potent lipophilic antioxidant that protects mitochondrial membrane phospholipids (like cardiolipin) and LDL cholesterol from oxidation. CoQ10 also prevents the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), inhibiting apoptosis.199  
CoQ10 modulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation (NF-κB pathway) and lipid metabolism. It is involved in sulfide metabolism (via sulfide-quinone reductase) and pyrimidine synthesis (via dihydroorotate dehydrogenase). Supplementation restores age-related declines in CoQ10 levels, particularly in high-energy tissues like the heart and brain, improving bioenergetics and reducing oxidative DNA damage.201

Geek Mode:  
Tongkat Ali's quassinoids (eurycomanone) act on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Eurycomanone stimulates the release of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which signal Leydig cells to produce testosterone. It also inhibits the aromatase enzyme (converting testosterone to estrogen) and displaces testosterone from Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), increasing free bioavailable testosterone. This anabolic support counteracts sarcopenia and frailty.203  
Tongkat Ali significantly lowers cortisol levels by modulating the stress response, improving the testosterone/cortisol ratio. Eurycomanone exhibits cytotoxic effects against cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (via p53 upregulation). It also demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing NF-κB. This modulation of hormonal signaling helps maintain Stem Cell pools and tissue regeneration capacity (Stem Cell Exhaustion).205

### **56\. L-Tryptophan**

| Feature | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functional Outcomes** | Sleep; Calm |
| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Altered Intercellular Communication; Chronic Inflammation; Cellular Senescence |

Geek Mode:  
L-Tryptophan is the precursor for serotonin, melatonin, and NAD+ (via the kynurenine pathway). In the brain, tryptophan hydroxylase converts it to 5-HTP, then serotonin. Serotonin regulates mood and sleep. However, 95% of tryptophan is metabolized via the kynurenine pathway, primarily in the liver and immune cells, driven by the enzymes TDO and IDO. While this pathway produces NAD+ (crucial for energy), chronic inflammation upregulates IDO, shifting metabolism towards neurotoxic metabolites (quinolinic acid) rather than serotonin or NAD+.207  
Supplementation aims to ensure adequate substrate for serotonin synthesis (improving sleep/mood) and de novo NAD+ synthesis. Maintaining tryptophan levels prevents the depletion of NAD+ and supports Sirtuin activity. It helps regulate the immune response (kynurenines modulate T-cell tolerance). Balancing tryptophan metabolism is key to preventing neurodegeneration and maintaining circadian rhythms.209

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Cellular Senescence; Chronic Inflammation; Stem Cell Exhaustion; Loss of Proteostasis |

Geek Mode:  
Fisetin is a flavonoid that functions as a potent senolytic. It selectively induces apoptosis in senescent cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAP network), which senescent cells rely on for survival. This clearance reduces the burden of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), lowering systemic inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α). Fisetin is effective against various senescent cell types, including adipocytes and endothelial cells.211  
Fisetin also activates SIRT1 and acts as a caloric restriction mimetic. In the brain, it promotes Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) via the CREB pathway and protects neurons from oxidative stress and amyloid toxicity. It maintains proteostasis by activating the proteasome and autophagy. Fisetin has been shown to extend healthspan and lifespan in mice by reducing senescent cell burden and preserving tissue function.213

### **58\. Quercetin**

Geek Mode:  
Quercetin acts as a senolytic by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xL pathways, as well as HSP90 (destabilizing pro-survival client proteins in senescent cells). It specifically targets senescent endothelial cells and bone marrow MSCs. Additionally, Quercetin is a potent Nrf2 activator, upregulating antioxidant enzymes and glutathione. It inhibits NF-κB translocation, suppressing the production of SASP factors (senomorphic effect).215  
Quercetin inhibits the CD38 enzyme (an NADase), thereby preserving NAD+ levels and supporting Sirtuin activity. It also exhibits antiviral and antihistamine properties (stabilizing mast cells). When combined with Dasatinib, it forms a broad-spectrum senolytic cocktail that clears multiple senescent cell lineages, rejuvenating tissues and improving physical function in aged models.217

Geek Mode:  
Piperlongumine (PL) is an alkaloid that selectively kills senescent cells by inducing a "ROS catastrophe." Senescent cells have higher basal ROS levels; PL binds to and inhibits antioxidant enzymes like GSTP1 and Carbonyl Reductase 1, depleting their glutathione defense. This causes ROS to spike above a lethal threshold, triggering apoptosis via DNA damage response, while sparing normal cells with lower ROS levels.219  
PL also inhibits the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways, potently suppressing inflammation and tumor growth. It interferes with the binding of transcription factors to DNA. PL has been shown to rejuvenate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by reducing ROS levels (at lower doses) or clearing senescent HSCs, improving the regenerative capacity of the blood system. It represents a ROS-dependent senolytic strategy.220

Geek Mode:  
Berberine is a potent activator of AMPK, likely via the inhibition of mitochondrial Complex I (increasing AMP/ATP ratio). Activated AMPK inhibits mTOR, stimulates glucose uptake (GLUT4), and enhances fatty acid oxidation, mimicking the metabolic effects of exercise and fasting. Berberine also upregulates the LDL Receptor (LDLR) via a post-transcriptional mechanism (stabilizing LDLR mRNA), lowering plasma cholesterol.222  
Berberine modulates the gut microbiota, reducing LPS-producing bacteria and increasing SCFA producers (like *Akkermansia*), which improves gut barrier integrity and reduces metabolic endotoxemia. It exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB. Berberine also induces autophagy and mitophagy, clearing damaged organelles. It improves insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function, addressing the core metabolic defects of aging.222

Geek Mode:  
This complex typically refers to the combination of Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q), sometimes augmented with Fisetin or Theaflavins. D+Q works synergistically: Dasatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) targets senescent adipocytes and progenitors by inhibiting ephrin dependency receptors (SCAP network). Quercetin targets senescent endothelial cells via Bcl-2/PI3K pathways. Together, they clear a wider range of senescent cells than either alone.218  
The clearance of senescent cells ("zombies") removes the source of the SASP (pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases), reducing systemic inflammation and tissue degradation. This rejuvenates stem cell niches, improves vascular reactivity, and alleviates physical dysfunction (frailty). The complex is administered intermittently ("hit-and-run") to allow for cell clearance without continuous drug exposure side effects.226

### **62\. Fisetin 2 (Duplicate Entry)**

Geek Mode:  
Low-dose Lithium acts as a neuroprotective agent primarily by inhibiting Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β). GSK-3β overactivity is linked to tau hyperphosphorylation (Alzheimer's), amyloid production, and cell death. By inhibiting GSK-3β (competing with magnesium), Lithium stabilizes β-catenin (Wnt pathway) and Nrf2, promoting neurogenesis, antioxidant defenses, and synaptic plasticity. It also induces autophagy via IMPase inhibition (mTOR-independent), clearing protein aggregates.228  
Lithium upregulates BDNF and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic). It modulates neurotransmission (glutamate/GABA) and regulates the circadian clock. Microdose lithium is associated with reduced all-cause mortality and preserved gray matter.

These compounds act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission and promoting sleep. The flavonoid Xanthohumol binds to melatonin receptors and may influence circadian rhythms. Hops also contain 8-prenylnaringenin, a potent phytoestrogen that can modulate hormonal signaling and thermoregulation (hot flashes).232  
Xanthohumol also activates the Nrf2 pathway and inhibits NF-κB, providing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. It acts as a mild sedative-hypnotic, improving sleep quality (increasing GABAergic tone) without the hangover effects of synthetic sedatives. Hops synergize with Valerian to improve sleep latency and maintenance.233

| **Hallmarks Impacted** | Epigenetic Alterations; Deregulated Nutrient Sensing; Chronic Inflammation; Stem Cell Exhaustion |

Geek Mode:  
Trimethylglycine (TMG) functions as a methyl donor. It donates a methyl group to homocysteine to regenerate methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). This reduces toxic homocysteine levels (cardioprotection) and restores the pool of S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the universal methyl donor. SAMe is essential for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases, maintaining the epigenetic code (Epigenetic Alterations).235  
By supporting methylation, TMG facilitates the synthesis of creatine, phosphatidylcholine, and carnitine. It acts as an osmolyte, protecting cells from hydration stress and stabilizing protein structures (chaperone activity). TMG is often paired with NMN, as NAM metabolism consumes methyl groups; TMG replenishes them, preventing methyl donor depletion and supporting sustained NAD+ synthesis.237

**3\. Conclusion: The Convergence of Mechanisms**

The dissection of these 96 entries reveals a remarkable convergence of biological mechanisms. Despite their diverse origins—ranging from deep-sea algae to Himalayan rocks and human gut bacteria—these molecules target a conserved set of master regulators that govern the rate of aging:

1. **The AMPK/mTOR Seesaw:** A dominant theme is the activation of AMPK (Metformin, Berberine, Gynostemma) and the inhibition of mTOR (Rapamycin, Urolithin A). This shift signals the cell to prioritize repair, autophagy, and stress resistance over unrestrained growth.  
2. **The NAD+/Sirtuin Axis:** Maintaining the cell's energetic and epigenetic fidelity is paramount. Precursors (NMN, NR) and activators (Resveratrol, Pterostilbene) work in tandem to keep the "silent information regulators" (Sirtuins) active, preserving genomic stability and mitochondrial function.  
3. **The Nrf2 Defense:** Rather than passively scavenging free radicals, the most potent agents (Sulforaphane, Curcumin, Astaxanthin) activate the Nrf2 pathway, upregulating the body's own arsenal of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes.  
4. **Senolysis and Autophagy:** Clearing the "trash" is essential. Senolytics (Fisetin, Quercetin) remove toxic zombie cells, while autophagy inducers (Spermidine, Trehalose) recycle intracellular debris.  
5. **The Gut-Brain-Immune Triad:** The microbiome emerges as a central regulator of systemic health. Probiotics, prebiotics, and mushroom polysaccharides modulate inflammation, neurotransmission, and immunity from the gut lumen.

This "Periodic Table" is not a static list but a dynamic toolkit. By understanding the specific "Geek Mode" mechanisms, we can move beyond generic supplementation to precision geroprotection—targeting the specific hallmarks that are the bottlenecks in an individual's healthspan. The future of longevity lies in the synergistic application of these molecular levers to engineer resilience against time.

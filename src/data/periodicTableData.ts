This property enables it to act as an \"electron sponge,\" effectively neutralizing superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals without becoming a pro-oxidant itself.2 Mechanistically, C60 accumulates within the mitochondrial lipid bilayer. Here, theoretical models and in vitro studies suggest it acts as a protonophore, facilitating a mild uncoupling of the mitochondrial membrane potential.2  \nThis mild uncoupling effect mimics the action of uncoupling proteins (UCPs), reducing the proton motive force slightly—enough to diminish the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at Complex I and III of the electron transport chain (ETC), but not enough to compromise ATP synthesis significantly. By lowering mitochondrial ROS production at the source, C60 protects mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from oxidative lesions (Genomic Instability) and preserves the structural integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Mitochondrial Dysfunction). Furthermore, C60 has been observed to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides and reduce neuroinflammation by modulating microglial activation, thereby addressing Loss of Proteostasis and Altered Intercellular Communication in neural tissues.4",

By replenishing intracellular GSH pools, NAC directly combats Genomic Instability and Mitochondrial Dysfunction caused by oxidative stress.6 GSH serves as the essential cofactor for glutathione peroxidase (GPx), an enzyme responsible for reducing hydrogen peroxide to water and detoxifying lipid hydroperoxides.  \nBeyond its role in GSH synthesis, the free thiol group of NAC possesses direct antioxidant activity, capable of scavenging hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid. NAC also modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission by activating the cystine-glutamate antiporter (System xc-), which increases non-synaptic glutamate levels to stimulate presynaptic mGluR2/3 receptors, thereby dampening excessive excitatory transmission. This mechanism is crucial for neuroprotection and reducing \"excitotoxicity.\" Furthermore, NAC has been shown to break disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, improving respiratory health, and to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 (Chronic Inflammation).7",

They bind to TLR4 receptors on macrophages and dendritic cells, stimulating the release of cytokines and enhancing phagocytic activity. Astragalus also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and reducing the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) on endothelial cells.

It is identified as the primary small molecule within Astragalus responsible for telomerase activation. Cycloastragenol acts by transiently increasing the transcription of hTERT, leading to increased telomerase activity in somatic cells. This elongation of critically short telomeres rescues cells from the Hayflick limit, allowing for continued cell division and tissue regeneration. This is particularly relevant for the skin (keratinocytes) and the immune system (CD4/CD8 T-cells), where telomere attrition limits functional capacity.35  \nIn addition to Telomere Attrition, Cycloastragenol impacts the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and survival. It has been shown to improve lipid metabolism and wound healing in vivo. Recent studies suggest it also modulates the Nrf2/proteasome axis, enhancing the degradation of damaged proteins (Loss of Proteostasis) and upregulating antioxidant enzymes. By maintaining telomere length, Cycloastragenol indirectly prevents Genomic Instability, as critically short telomeres can lead to chromosome fusion and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles.37",

In the context of reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), Vitamin C alleviates senescence by downregulating p53/p21 via H3K36 demethylation. It creates a permissive epigenetic state for cellular rejuvenation. Furthermore, high-dose Vitamin C can selectively kill cancer cells with KRAS/BRAF mutations by inducing oxidative stress via the accumulation of DHA (dehydroascorbate) and subsequent glutathione depletion.74",

Bacterial fermentation of inulin produces Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyrate. Butyrate feeds colonocytes, maintains gut barrier integrity, and inhibits HDACs in immune cells (inducing T-regs). SCFAs bind to G-protein coupled receptors (FFAR2/3) on enteroendocrine cells, stimulating GLP-1 release (satiety, insulin sensitivity). Inulin modulation of the microbiome reduces systemic inflammation and improves metabolic health.299",

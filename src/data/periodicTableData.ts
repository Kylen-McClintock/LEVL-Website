Most notably, it is required for the activity of Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes (TET1/2/3). TET enzymes catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a key step in active DNA demethylation. By enhancing TET activity, Vitamin C maintains the epigenetic landscape, preventing the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and maintaining stem cell pluripotency (Epigenetic Alterations/Stem Cell Exhaustion).<sup>72</sup>  \nVitamin C is also a cofactor for collagen prolyl hydroxylases, enzymes essential for the formation of the collagen triple helix structure. This ensures the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in skin, blood vessels, and bone. In the context of reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), Vitamin C alleviates senescence by downregulating p53/p21 via H3K36 demethylation. It creates a permissive epigenetic state for cellular rejuvenation. Furthermore, high-dose Vitamin C can selectively kill cancer cells with KRAS/BRAF mutations by inducing oxidative stress via the accumulation of DHA (dehydroascorbate) and subsequent glutathione depletion.<sup>74</sup>",

**10\. Conclusion**

This exhaustive review of the 96 entries in the "Periodic Table of Longevity Molecules" 1 demonstrates that geroprotection is a network science. No single molecule operates in isolation; their effects on the Hallmarks of Aging are amplified, sustained, or modulated by their synergistic partners. From the mitochondrial optimization of CoQ10 and PQQ to the senolytic precision of Fisetin and Quercetin, the pharmacopoeia offers a diverse toolkit for targeting the fundamental mechanisms of aging. Future interventions will likely move beyond single-agent paradigms toward the combinatorial architectures detailed in this report.
